Unify the P and C types. This _almost_ works where:
     type P a = C () a
but then the Applicative instance won't work when
you try to ap a C to a P.

Parallelize the Applicative instance somehow?

Currently, there is no enforcement of the distribution
domain. If you have a P Int, you have no idea how
many ints actually are present, and if you try to
multiply that by a C Int, you have no idea if the
_same_ ints are present.
